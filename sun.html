    <h1>Sun</h1>
    <p>
        The Sun is the Solar System's star and by far its most massive component. Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses), which comprises 99.86% of all the mass in the Solar System, produces temperatures and densities in its core high enough to sustain nuclear
        fusion of hydrogen into helium.This releases an enormous amount of energy, mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium, it is a main-sequence star. More specifically, it is a G2-type main-sequence star, where the type designation refers to its effective temperature. Hotter main-sequence stars are more luminous. The Sun's temperature
        is intermediate between that of the hottest stars and that of the coolest stars. Stars brighter and hotter than the Sun are rare, whereas substantially dimmer and cooler stars, known as red dwarfs, make up about 75% of the stars in the Milky Way.
